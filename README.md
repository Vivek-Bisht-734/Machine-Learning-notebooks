# Project 1: Sonar-Rock-Mine-Prediction

**Short description:** A compact project to train and evaluate a classifier (Logistic Regression) on the Sonar dataset to predict whether a sonar return is from a **rock** or a **mine** (metal cylinder). Intended as a reproducible demo and reference notebook for submarine sonar classification.

This repository contains a reproducible notebook that builds a logistic regression classifier on the Sonar dataset to predict whether a sonar signal corresponds to a rock or a metal mine. The notebook includes data loading, exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation (accuracy_score).

### Dataset
* **Source:** Sonar dataset (Rocks vs Mines)
* **Columns:** 60 numeric attributes (sonar measurements) + 1 label column (`R` or `M` / `Rock` or `Mine`).

### Environment & Requirements
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
